## Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

### High Availability

High Availability it's the ability to be resilient regarding events that may occur.
So it refers to the ability of applications to simply be avaible.

### Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
If you need more virtual machine you can add more virtual machine handling better the increased demand.

Scaling can be:
- Vertical: ability to do hardware upgrade/downgrade.
- Horizontal: ability to add or drop more virtual devices.

## Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud

### Reliability
Reliability is the ability to recover from disaster and failures.
Cloud computing is decentralized by design you can project you architecture to be resilient from disaster using cloud computing.
You can configure the designed architecture to be automatically shifted to other cloud region if something bad occurs.

### Predictability
Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.
Azure  has frameworks for do some of this stuff.

### Cost
With cloud you can track how much active resources are spending and apply data analytics to find patterns
Cost predictability is done by some tools that azure offer like Ttotal Cost of Ownership or Pricing Calculator.


## Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
Cloud supports governance and compliance,
Templates can help ensuring fovernment regulatory requirements.
On the security side, by the nature of the cloud (services over the internet) it's secure by design providers are tipically well suited to handle things like DDosS attacks offering a robust and secure network to use.

# Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

In cloud you can:
- Automatically scale resource deployment
- Deploy resources using templates
- Recieve alerts based on configured metrics

## Management in the cloud

You can manage cloud trough various tools:
- web portal
- CLI
- APIS
- Powershell
